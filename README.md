## Tweetr-Angular

This is the Single-Page-Application interface for the [Tweetr-Application](https://github.com/Venuor/Tweetr).

Users can sign up or login into Tweetr and immediately start writing tweets limited to
140 characters. 

The app features a global feed listing all Tweets of all users chronologically. Users can also
follow each other to view their Tweets on a personal feed. This feed only displays the Tweets of 
users you are subscribed to.

There also exists an admin user which can delete any user and Tweet.

This app was build for educational purposes and is hosted on [a private server](https://rspiess.ddns.net/tweetr).
